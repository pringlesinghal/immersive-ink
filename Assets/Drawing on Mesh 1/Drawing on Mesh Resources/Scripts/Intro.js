/*

IN 'DRAWING SCRIPT' YOU CAN ADJUST SIZE OF BRUSH
TEXTURE AND WITH THAT SHAPE AND COLOR OF IT,

IN UNLIT MATERIAL OF 'MESH FOR DRAWING OBJECT' IF
YOU WANT TO DRAW OVER SOME OTHER MATERIAL(S) 
SET BLEND MODE OF IT TO 'NORMAL'

EVERYTHING ELSE SHOULD STAY THE SAME

OR GO AHEAD AND EXPERIMENT AT YOUR WAYS

PEACE PEACO
